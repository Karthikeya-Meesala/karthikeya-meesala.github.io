# writing emails

![writing emails](media/writing-emails.png)

writing good emails is an actual skill, and well crafted emails tend to get reverts lot faster than you think. i follow the below when writing emails.

- 2-3 paragraphs at most with 2 lines each.

- should ideally answer these questions:
    1. who are you?
    2. what do you want?
    3. what should i do to help?

- subject line is just be the "ask".

if you want to give it a shot, feel free to write [me](mailto:mkarthikeya41@gmail.com) one.

# execution. 

there's no billion dollar idea. no one will steal your idea, it's literally worth nothing.

only thing between you, your competitiors and the market (billion dollars) is your execution. that's the only moat you will and can ever have. 

go talk to users. execute and iterate. execute faster than yesterday.
